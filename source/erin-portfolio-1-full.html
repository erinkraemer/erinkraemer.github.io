Normally we start the conversation by introducing ourselves and shotline to give the agent a bit of context. The agent was skeptical of our service, was worried we didn‚Äôt have consent to be providing or accessing the patient‚Äôs information, and didn‚Äôt know how to solve our difficult case and elevated it to her manager. I was told to expect a callback on the following monday. The next day, the agent sent me an email about our process asking us to have our patients on the phone when calling them. It doesn‚Äôt sound like a huge ask, but it was an absolute logistical nightmare and impossible for us to implement. In my reply I wrote back a little about our organization and told her it wasn‚Äôt possible. I was terrified that we were going to lose access to that vaccine provider. A senior vice president called me on Sunday for more information about shotline. When she introduced herself, I was certain that it was over. However, she wanted instead to see how we could partner. After meeting with her and the general manager of california on Monday,¬† We now have direct, guaranteed access to vaccination appointments at 25 different sites in 8 counties across california.</p><p id="4d52d8fb-7984-4d02-baa8-4133347d9f96" class="">At the end of April, our hotline was featured in the San Francisco Chronical. </p><p id="b6c08d26-adb3-4351-8150-f3ce8b47126d" class="">Finally, we presented the Shotline at the ETR.
