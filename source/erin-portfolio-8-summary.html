					<h3 class="mb-4">Connecting Stopouts</h3>
					<p>“Stop-In” is a digital platform that aims to facilitate social engagement and is targeted to a particularly marginalized population at UC Berkeley: students who stopout (temporarily withdraw) from school. 
					</br>
						These students, who are largely disregarded by both administration and their former classmates following their official withdrawal, often experience debilitating feelings of shame, self-blame, and social isolation, which makes returning to college even more of a challenge. 
					</br>	
						Our digital platform will allow stopout students to connect with each other, with peers who have returned to school after withdrawing, and with mental health professionals who can support their social and emotional wellbeing.</p>
